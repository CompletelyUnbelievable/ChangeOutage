# HalfGuildsBar
Changes the size of the guilds and the guilds bar to half their origional size. As a suggestion, keep the sizes as consistant as possible. Discord user Poptarts (186931998055464960) asked if the size of the guildsbar could be changed to be smaller.

# ChangeOutage
Changes the exclamation point in Discord guild outages to the Better Discord logo.

Discord user tehbasshunter (66043140208857088) asked if the text could be replaced with an image on the guild outage element, I also left the ability to replace the text as well.

# ReplaceHomeButton

Discord user 𝓒𝓸𝓶𝓪 (308340703153356801) asked how to preoperly add a background image to the home icon. While discord user Body Pullow (116242787980017679) desired the hovered background color to be a different color.

# GradientHomeIcon

Discord user Ruben7173 (300024006462144512) was/is working on a theme and I noticed that ruben was using a modified image of the discord logo to replace the origional image. I wanted to see if there was a way to use linear gradient to replicate it out of purely css, to which this was my solution. Makes the home icon on the home button a configuarable linear gradient. I am left to assume that webkit is supported on all versions of discord since I cannot check myself, if it isn't please notify me.
