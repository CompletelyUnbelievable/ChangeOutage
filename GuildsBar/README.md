# HalfGuildsBar
Changes the size of the guilds and the guilds bar to half their origional size. As a suggestion, keep the sizes as consistant as possible. Discord user Poptarts (186931998055464960) asked if the size of the guildsbar could be changed to be smaller.

# ChangeOutage
Changes the exclamation point in Discord guild outages to the Better Discord logo.

Discord user tehbasshunter (66043140208857088) asked if the text could be replaced with an image on the guild outage element, I also left the ability to replace the text as well.
