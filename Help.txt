If you would like a custom image:

1) Use the ChangeOutage theme. (Or if you are a developer, import the css in the Imports folder.)
2) Add the css below to a theme or in your custom css.
3) The link you add must have "https" at the beginning and something such as ".png" or ".jpg" at the end of the link in order to work.

.guilds-wrapper .guilds-error::after {
    background-image: url(https://completelyunbelievable.github.io/ChangeOutage/Image/BD%20Logo.png) !important;
}
