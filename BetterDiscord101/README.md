This is for topics that may interest future BD theme developers, to help explain some introductory and finer details of such development. This is meant to explain certain topics and why understanding them is necessary.

Though some topics discuss purely CSS related features, I am not trying to teach CSS so if you want to learn to make themes then you still need to learn CSS or be able to fake it.
