User BloodPSTL (118854717370531846) was having issues getting an image to work on a modified version of the Dark Matter theme, this show why images might not be centered correctly with CSS.

Since I don't want anyone importing any styles here, that link may not work. If this is the case just save the HTML file and open it in any browser.
