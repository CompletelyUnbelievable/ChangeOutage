# Images Not Loading

<div>In order for images to load as backgrounds or otherwise in BetterDiscord the image link must contain:<br><br>
  
  <ul>
    <li>HTTPS at the beginning of the link to the image. [<b>https</b>://i.imgur.com/iNq5zmg.png]</li>
    <li>Must end with an image filetype: <b>.png</b>, <b>.jpg</b>, or something similar. [https://i.imgur.com/iNq5zmg<b>.png</b>]</li>
    <li>Beyond this, then it is probably a typo in the CSS file. Generally caused by the general user.</li>
  </ul></div>

User BloodPSTL (118854717370531846) was having issues getting an image to work on a modified version of the Dark Matter theme, this show why images might not be centered correctly with CSS. Feel free to use this simple <a href="https://github.com/CompletelyUnbelievable/ThemeResource/blob/master/BetterDiscord101/ImageIssues/OddlySizedImagesExample.html">example</a> file to make sure images are centered properly, just replace the imgur link with a direct link to the image you want to check.</div>
