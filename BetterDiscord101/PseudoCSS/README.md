Most information will be pulled from here, at least in reguards on how to use this information: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_elements.asp

If there is an element that you cannot seem to modify, specifically cannot see the styles of, then it is probably due to pseudo elements. For instance, every single scrollbar in discord is a pseudo element. Some pseudo elements are are unique to the browser, discord is based off either the Google Chrome or Chromium browsers. Not to be confused with pseudo classes, that can be seen normally, which are a listed at the end of that page above.
