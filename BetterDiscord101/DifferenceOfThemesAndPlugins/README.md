Plugins are used to modify things that themes cannot, that might be simple but it ends up being vague to some. This is to specify the differences.

1) CSS/Themes can not add functionality to discord, but might be able to remove it.
2) CSS generally changes the way one perceives discord. Typically not by adding, though there are exceptions with pseudo elements.
3) Styles can be changed through CSS, but elements cannot be changed through CSS. Meaning you cant add things that you could when developing a website (HTML), such as tags. As with #2 there can be work-arounds to this.

This is an ongoing list, this might not specify everything but I plan to build upon it in the future.
