Plugins are used to modify things that themes cannot, that might be simple but it ends up being vague to some. This is to specify the differences. Themes are just CSS with a META at the top, so think of them as essentially the same thing here.

1) CSS can not add functionality to discord, but might be able to hide it.
2) CSS generally changes the way one perceives discord. Typically not by adding, though there are exceptions with pseudo elements.
3) Styles can be changed through CSS, but elements cannot be changed through CSS. Meaning you can't add things that you could when developing a website (HTML), such as tags. As with #2 there can be work-arounds to this.
4) CSS can hide things, but cannot remove them. There is CSS that is given around to hide the blocked messages bar when a blocked user posts to a channel, the element is still there but you can't see it.
5) Though singling out elements based on criteria is possible in CSS, it isn't always viable to make the changes desired. For example: You can single out the Discord ID of an individual to select and modify their message in the message area, but you cannot specify which message so every message from them would be modified.

This is an ongoing list. This might not specify everything, maybe not clearly either, but I plan to build upon it in the future.
