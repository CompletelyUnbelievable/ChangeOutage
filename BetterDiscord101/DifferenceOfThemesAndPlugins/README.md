Plugins are used to modify things that themes cannot, that might be simple but it ends up being vague to some. This is to specify the differences. Themes are just CSS with a META at the top, so think of them as essentially the same thing here.

1) CSS can not add functionality to discord, but might be able to hide it.
2) CSS generally changes the way one perceives discord. Typically not by adding, though there are exceptions with pseudo elements.
3) Styles can be changed through CSS, but elements cannot be changed through CSS. Meaning you cant add things that you could when developing a website (HTML), such as tags. As with #2 there can be work-arounds to this.
4) CSS can hide things, but cannot remove them. There is CSS that is given around to hide the blocked messages bar when a blocked user posts to a channel, the element is still there but you cant see it.

This is an ongoing list. This might not specify everything, maybe not clearly either, but I plan to build upon it in the future.
