If a theme is not showing up on your list of themes in your Better Discord settings, then this is the first thing you should check.

It is a common mistake to save the theme file incorrectly. The theme file type should be, "CSS File", with a name such as "TheThemeName.theme".

But the best way to prevent this is to make sure the mistake does not happen from the start. The image below is how a theme should look while you are saving it:
