If a theme is not showing up on your list of themes in your Better Discord settings, then making sure it is saved correctly is the first thing one should check. If this does not work see my folder on ThemeMeta to explain another reason why it might not be showing up.

It is a common mistake to save the theme file incorrectly. The theme file type should be, "CSS File", with a name such as "TheThemeName.theme". Otherwise it should be "TheThemeName.theme.css" if you set windows explorer to show file extensions in the filename.

But the best way to prevent this is to make sure the mistake does not happen from the start. The image below is how a theme should look while you are saving it:
