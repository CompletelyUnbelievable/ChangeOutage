# Attribution in regards to redistribution

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<div>Attribution is a rather complex topic, since it will vary depending on how much or what is used. In regards to CSS styles in relation to BD, I do not believe that anyone would be arrogant enough to say that one's work should be unreproducible. I do not believe that anyone wants their own work to end with them, with sufficient attribution and transformation of the work a person should be able to build upon the work of others.</div>

<h3>Expressing intent to use</h3>

<div>To begin it is best to express one's intent to use or "borrow" such works to the author, as it is a good gesture to the author. Answering any questions they may have will give you or the author the chance to discuss/negotiate attribution, if any at all. As with anything there is a chance at flat out rejection to which should be understood and respected, but nothing stops a person from learning from their example and finding your own way. Any significant plagiarism can lead to one being ostracized, or worse.</div>

<h3>A Measure</h3>

<div>Defining how much can be used or "borrowed" without the permission of the author is something difficult to tackle because in the best possible scenario the author or the community should define that themselves. Things with clear and expressed intent to assist development, such as the CSS styles in ThemeResource, or sometimes "Mini-Themes" should be free to use without expressing intent. The use of ten or less selectors should be fine without attribution as long as it does not contain any significant other work such as art and your own work occupies the majority of the given work.</div>
