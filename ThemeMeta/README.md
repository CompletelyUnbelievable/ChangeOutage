This is a theme 101 topic and better discord theme developers already understand this, this is meant to explain what it is and why it is necessary to those that do not understand or to whom it is not clear to.

If a theme does not show up on the theme menu after restarting discord and verifying the Better Discord install there are two causes and should be checked in this order:
1) The name of the theme file is incorrect (see the ThemeName folder for instructions)
2) The theme meta is broken

Theme meta is one of the major things that allows Better discord themes to be used and understood by itself defining names, descriptions, versions, etc. If a theme is without a meta, then it is not a theme, it is only a bunch of stylings pertaining to better discord.

Some themes will have special instructions in their meta that mean something else, such as "/n" being an instruction to go to the next line. These instructions are carried over from different coding languages, and are completely valid in the theme meta without breaking the theme.
