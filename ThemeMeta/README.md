This is a theme 101 topic and better discord theme developers already understand this, this is meant to explain what it is and why it is necessary.


Theme meta is one of the major things that allows Better discord themes to be used and understood by itself. If a theme is without a meta, then it is not a theme, it is only a bunch of stylings pertaining to better discord.

Some themes will have special characters in their meta that mean something else, such as "/n" being an instruction to goto the next line.
