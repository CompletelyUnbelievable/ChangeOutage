# TitlebarFix

A minor fix for the titlebar of the discord window. Improves the shape of the box so that the background does not seep into the foreground, makes changes to background colors to the titlebar look better as well. This improvement was instigated by discord user Superman (208718331325317121) who wanted their background image to be visible through the titlebar.

# ReplaceDiscordLogo

This allows you to change the Discord logo, in the top right of the window, with another image. Discord user Poptarts (186931998055464960) asked if the discord logo could be changed into something else.
