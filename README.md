# ChangeOutage
Changes the exclamation point in Discord guild outages to the Better Discord logo

I made this page just to save the work somewhere for someone else to use, because I would loose it otherwise.

This is not really a theme so it will not be getting any bug support activly, discord would have to make major changes in order for this to break. (That is why issues on this github page are disabled) If I get contacted about repairing an issue with this, then I might take a look and see what can be done. It should be understood by this point that other themes and plugins may interfere with this, and restarting discord can fix those issues as well.
