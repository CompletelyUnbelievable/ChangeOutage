Welcome to the index for Better Discord theme development. This will be where I store snippets of CSS code for various different projects. The help I give out might end up here so that other theme developers can use it, as well to save time with repeated questions.


There are theme file(s) in each folder to make a quick change, but if the theme you are using this with is lazy then it might not work. Overuse of "!important", plugins, better selectors, etc can possibly cause issues with using these. I am trying to avoid using lazy methods as much as possible, so if it is used there is a reason it would have to used.
