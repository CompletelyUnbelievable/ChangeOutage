Welcome to the index for Better Discord theme development. This will be where I store snippets of CSS code for various different projects. The help I give out might end up here so that other theme developers can use it, as well to save time with repeated questions.


There are theme file(s) in each folder to make a quick change, but might not work with lazily made themes. The main issue with lazily made themes would be overuse of "!important" because it means that if they modify those same element(s) styles then their styles take precident over any of these. I am trying to avoid using lazy methods as much as possible, if I use it then there is a reason.


I will be using normalized classes for as long as they are not depricated, everything within ThemeResource has been updated with the most possible use of normalized classes as of 13/8/2018 (dd/mm/yyyy).
