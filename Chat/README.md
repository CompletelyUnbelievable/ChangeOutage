# Block Whole Discord Invites and Pseudo Replace Discord Invites

<div>Discord user jolvian (491013380728029195) wanted a way to hide discord invite links. Block whole invite links removes the links from the user message, the embed from the user message if the link was embeded, and the guild add button from the guilds wrapper.<br>
<br>
Pseudo replace discord invites was my attempt at notifing the user when a link was removed, but the issue is that you can just click the link from the text and there is nothing that can be done about that except with a plugin.</div>
