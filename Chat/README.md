# Block Whole Discord Invites and Pseudo Replace Discord Invites

<div>Discord user jolvian (491013380728029195) wanted a way to hide discord invite links. Block whole discord invites removes the links from the user message, the embed from the user message if the link was embedded, and the guild add button from the guilds wrapper. An issue that cannot be fixed is that if a user only posts a link then the message box will appear empty.<br>
<br>
Pseudo replace discord invites was my attempt at notifying the user when a link was removed, but the issue is that you can just click the link from the disguised text and there is nothing that can be done about that except with a plugin. These snippets are not meant to be used together, since block whole discord invites will override the other.</div>
