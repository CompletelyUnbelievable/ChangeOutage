# ContentImprovements

Makes improvements to things below the titlebar that do not fall under another category. Currently this should not be used with the old titlebar, this is meant to make improvements to modern discord only. Currently allows for dark and light theme selectors to be used with the background image while also allowing the image to be behind the titlebar.

# <a href="https://github.com/CompletelyUnbelievable/ThemeResource/tree/master/Titlebar">TitlebarFix</a>

A minor fix for the titlebar of the discord window. Improves the shape of the box so that the background does not seep into the foreground, makes changes to background colors to the titlebar look better as well.
