# ContentImprovements

Makes improvements to things below the titlebar that do not fall under another category. Currently this should not be used with the old titlebar, this is meant to make improvements to modern discord only. Currently allows for dark and light theme selectors to be used with the background image while also allowing the image to be behind the titlebar.
