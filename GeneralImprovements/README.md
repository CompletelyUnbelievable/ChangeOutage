# ContentImprovements

<div>Makes improvements to things below the titlebar that do not fall under another category. Currently this should not be used with the old titlebar, this is meant to make improvements to modern discord only. Currently allows for dark and light theme selectors to be used with the background image while also allowing the image to be behind the titlebar.</div>

# <a href="https://github.com/CompletelyUnbelievable/ThemeResource/tree/master/Titlebar">TitlebarFix</a>

<div>Though not in this page because it fits into another category, TitlebarFix is a general improvement. A minor fix for the titlebar of the discord window. Improves the shape of the box so that the background does not seep into the foreground, makes changes to background colors to the titlebar look better as well. This improvement was instigated by discord user Superman (208718331325317121) who wanted their background image to be visible through the titlebar.</div>
